<p>Let's talk about performance reviews <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>. Consistently, performance reviews
have been uncomfortable for me. I feel awkward about the standard questions used
in reviews and in self-assessments and don't want to go through the process. Yet
they are a common feature and they keep happening so if performance is going to
be reviewed, I would like to make it meaningful. What should "performance" mean
then, and what does it suggest about my career advancement?</p>
<div class="section" id="performance">
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>As a coder, my performance could take the form of having done some work. Let's
say I built some features and I fixed some bugs. This is the 'what' of the work.
That is why I get a paycheck, but says nothing obvious about how valuable I have
been to the product, to the team, or to the organization.</p>
<p>Should you gauge my performance by the particular work done? How did the work I
completed get selected? Did I choose politically sensitive work to garner
recognition and did I appear to succeed in the work? For piece work this may
be less of a concern but for knowledge workers it seems like this thinking isn't
what we should incentivize.</p>
<p>Another measure of the value is in 'how' I did the work. I'd like to suggest
that how I do the work, specifically what I learned from doing the
work, is a better indicator of performance and value to the organization. This
could be a basis for performance review and considering recognition for
achievements (and if your org does titles maybe this can be valuable in marking
advancement in titles too <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-as-performance">
<h2>Learning as Performance</h2>
<p>One of the rewards of working on software is that there are a lot of
opportunities to solve new problems all the time --variety! A former coworker
once observed (I paraphrase) that our job is to be struggling, to be challenged.
As soon as we overcome one challenge, there is another one waiting for us and
it's time to move on to that.</p>
<p>If we are going to spend the great majority of our time struggling through that
next thing, it makes sense that we will feel our productivity ebb and flow as
we charge through the open to the next blockade, then slow to circumvent it. We
can mark our professional development in part by our raw productivity, but the
greater part of our professional growth comes from the breakthroughs.</p>
<p>If my daily routine is going to be one continuous learning process, and that
learning is the function by which I increase my technical capabilities and
productivity, then this is a fair measure of my increasing value as an employee
to the organization. If my organization values individual capability and
productivity increasing the same throughout the team and the organization, let's
think about how we can reflect that in setting career paths, marking
achievements, and conducting performance reviews.</p>
<p>What could be gained by looking through the lense of learnings?</p>
<p>By including, or possibly centering on, learnings in performance reviews, we
can discuss all of our work in non-threatening terms of insights and lessons and
discoveries rather than letting the hard times be seen as oversights, failures,
or mistakes. We can also acknowledging the professional growth on each
individual by talking about individual learning and achievements.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>In the next part I will explore ways to recognize and keep track of the
individual learnings so they are available at performance review time.</p>
