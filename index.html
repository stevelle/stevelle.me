<p>Let's talk about performance reviews <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/learning-as-performance-1/#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>. Consistently, performance reviews
have been uncomfortable for me. I feel awkward about the standard questions used
in reviews and in self-assessments and don't want to go through the process
because there will always be some uncomfortable moments in there which would be
easier to not revisit. Yet they remain a common feature of almost all
organizations of any size and they keep happening so if performance is going to
be reviewed, I would like to make it meaningful. What should "performance" mean
then, and what does it suggest about my career advancement?</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem-with-performance">
<h2>The Problem with Performance</h2>
<p>As a coder, my performance could take the form of having done some body of work.
Let's say I built some features and I fixed some bugs. This is the 'what' of the
work. Should you gauge my performance by the particular work done? Then we must
ask more questions: How did the work I completed get selected? Did I choose
politically sensitive work to garner recognition and did I appear to succeed in
the work of did the value of the work under perform expectations? All of this
can be corrupted by independant variables and any measure can be gamed which
means instead of measuring my performance you are effectively measuring the
weather.</p>
<p>For piece-work jobs this may be "good enough" but for knowledge workers the
organization's primary metrics might not be what the best criteria to gague
individual performance. For knowledge workers to keep your organization growing
and to accelerate that growth to keep ahead of competitors you need their
productivity to grow over time. The difficult fact is that given the
increasing cost of maintaining software over time as feature bloat, technical
debt, and code rot set in often causes a slowing of productivity <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/learning-as-performance-1/#id5" id="id2">[2]</a>. This
makes it even more dangerous for your knowledge workers to be just treading
water. Learning is obligatory.</p>
<p>Another measure of the value of my work in an organization is in 'how' I did the
work. I'd like to suggest that how I do the work, specifically what I learned
from doing the work, is a better indicator of performance and value to the
organization. This could be a basis for performance review and considering
recognition for achievements (and if your org does titles maybe this can be
valuable in marking advancement in titles too <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/learning-as-performance-1/#id6" id="id3">[3]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-as-performance">
<h2>Learning as Performance</h2>
<p>One of the rewards of working on software is that there are a lot of
opportunities to solve new problems all the time --variety! A former coworker
once observed (I paraphrase) that our job is to be struggling, to be challenged.
As soon as we overcome one challenge, there is another one waiting for us and
it's time to move on to that.</p>
<p>We are going to spend the great majority of our time struggling through that
next thing. We can mark our professional development in part by our raw
productivity, but the greater part of our professional growth comes from the
breakthroughs: the monster bugs fixed or the finesse of implementing a feature.</p>
<p>If my daily routine is going to be one continuous learning process, and that
learning is the function by which I increase my technical capabilities and
productivity, then this is a fair measure of my increasing value as an employee
to the organization. If my organization values individual capability and
productivity increasing, let's think about how we can reflect that in setting
career paths, marking individual and team achievements, and conducting
performance reviews.</p>
<p>What could be gained by looking at reviews through the lense of learnings?</p>
<p>By including, or centering on, learned lessons in performance reviews we can
discuss all of our work in non-threatening terms; finding insights and lessons
and discoveries rather than letting the hard times be seen as oversights,
failures, or mistakes.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>In the next part I will explore ways to recognize and keep track of the
individual learnings so they are available at performance review time.</p>

<p>Most of my time in software development is spent reading and thinking about code
<a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/write-once-read-many/#id8" id="id1">[1]</a> rather than writing it. This is not a groundbreaking revelation <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/write-once-read-many/#id9" id="id2">[2]</a> but it
is particularly true for me.</p>
<p>I tend to balance a little more on the side of preferring quality over speed of
delivery. That means when I write code I will often want to look at it and
shuffle the logic. The editing process is rewarding for me. I thrive on the
puzzle, in rearranging the pieces, shaving here and gluing there to make the
shape serve this purpose or that one better.</p>
<p>I got to exercise that recently when I was reviewing a change and find the

<p>Myself, I like functional style solutions to problems. But in Python it can take
a form that looks unlike many others. The lambda syntax is a bit verbose. The
primitive building blocks to functional style like <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">filter</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">reduce</tt> functions are relegated to the corner and the alternatives are
promoted (moved from builtin space to functools in Python 3). All of this holds
with the Zen of Python <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/write-once-read-many/#id12" id="id5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt> usage here is basic. If you can't read that the purpose is to
generate a list of <tt class="docutils literal">True</tt> of <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt> values, one for each entry in the
<tt class="docutils literal">migrations</tt> list. It is the equivalent to either of the following:</p>

<p>But what is that <tt class="docutils literal">reduce</tt> operation doing? To read that at a first pass it
helps to have experience working in functional languages in which case you might
have seen the pattern. Reduce will take N items as input and reduce them to a
single output, in this case <tt class="docutils literal">True</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>. This reduce expression
(<tt class="docutils literal">x or y</tt>) then will just <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt> the list returned by the <tt class="docutils literal">map</tt> operation.

<p>Either of these would be a great solution. They are both explicit, simple, and
easy to explain.</p>
<p>The first is also flat and readable. The list comprehension <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/write-once-read-many/#id13" id="id6">[6]</a> is the most
complex yet concise element here, but with a basic familiarity with
comprehensions it reads very well.</p>
<p>The second relies on syntax that anyone who has done a couple weeks of
programming in nearly any language can decipher (I avoided the use of for-else
because while it would be technically correct it is an unnecessary use of that
language feature and more verbose) but it has non-linear flow control and while
the logic is simple it doesn't convey meaning concisely.</p>
<p>We can do better.</p>

<p>Now the code reads beautifully. If you forgive the syntax and a bit of the
dialect of writing software, it expresses an idea simply:</p>
<blockquote>
"Does any x has_migrations for each x in migrations?"</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
"Does any object in this list have migrations to perform?"</blockquote>
<p>When someone comes back to read this, it should take very little time to
comprehend regardless of their experience level with the language. When we
strive toward any of these last two sets of solutions and use the concise and
unambiguous elements of our language we place a lower working memory load <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/write-once-read-many/#id14" id="id7">[7]</a>
on ourselves and others. We are not likely to spend less time reading code, in
the end for a few reasons but if we apply this refinement technique in some
parts of a project that frees us to focus on the hard parts that really are
complex.</p>

<p>I might be taking things too far with my development environments, but I really
don't like the idea that my development environment might be special. That
could mean many things.</p>
<p>Consider the case where my development environment has lots of stuff installed
which might not be enumerated in the Developer Documentation or Getting Started
guide or README file that makes things work for me but keeps others from being
able to quickly have the same success with whatever environment they might be
starting from. That is a rotten way to onboard new team members or welcome new
contributors, so keeping yourself aware of what it takes to go from zero to
developing is important.</p>
<p>I deteste the similar case where my development environment has lots of stuff
installed which cause my environment to behave differently from an automated
testing environment or any place it might be deployed. There are a lot of ways
to get an advantage over this particular gremlin too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I loath the situation where you have to work on a new or temporary
device, or you end up having to nuke and start over with a fresh operating
system. Lose all produtivity while you install and customize your working
environment during production environment outage due to a critical bug one time
and you might feel the same.</p>
<p>So I realize that app containers are the hotness, but none of the apps I work on
for OpenStack or for Rackspace include manifests for the dominant container
orchestration tools. That isn't to say nobody has run them in Docker, but I'm
not really that interested in dinking around with deploying all the various
pieces needed and fixing all the broken windows along the way.</p>
<p>Take the Glance project as an example. A typical deploy of Glance requires
MariaDB, RabbitMQ, Glance API, Glance Registry, the ability to run Glance Manage
and Glance Cache, and possibly also a Glance Scrubber in daemon mode in order to
have a complete ecosystem. That is all needed just to use the filesystem storage
driver in the container. I don't really want to maintain 7 different app
containers on my development host box (murdering my battery life as they spin up
and down). That is neglecting the need to keep 3 versions of each manifest of
the deploy tools tailored to the needs of each branch of Glance (master an 2
stable branches) in service at a time as well as having each manifest accomodate
the various customizations needed in service configuration, and keep them all in
sync.</p>
<p>This is in part why we have Devstack <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/disposable-development-environments/#id6" id="id1">[1]</a> within the OpenStack community, as it
provides a ready-to-eat means of deploying and configuing all the pieces to a
single [virtual] host. That could be an OS container <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/disposable-development-environments/#id7" id="id2">[2]</a> (such as LXD <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/disposable-development-environments/#id8" id="id3">[3]</a>) as
well, but whatever.</p>
<p>I work from any of two different Mac laptops a Windows desktop, or a Linux
workstation, but mostly I work from one of the laptops. The churn of builds and
package installs is slower locally and kills my laptop's battery life, so I use
virtual machines in the Rackspace public cloud for almost all of my work. But
this requires a fair bit of machinery, I want pip to install the right python
package versions of the OpenStack and Nova clients, and their prerequisites. I
want the right cloud.yml or open.rc file which are used to contain authorization
credentials and I want to ensure my SSH private key is used for authentication.
And even then, I don't want to use the OpenStack or Nova client directly, when
there are only two to three things I might want different between each virtual
machine instance I work from, (name, flavor, image).</p>
<p>So I go one step further. I install VirtualBox and Vagrant directly on the
laptop, and I pull down one private git repository in order to get the laptop
set up as a development environment.  From there it's as easy as changing
directory into the repository and entering one command.</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_b58eb053246a455ba75eeb2cbb240862-1"></a>$ vagrant up &amp;&amp; vagrant ssh
</pre>
<p>The git repository has a Vagrantfile which specifies a current distro release to
use as a development jumpbox. The provisioning scripting in the Vagrantfile sets
up all of the libraries, SSH Agent, and credentials for me under the vagrant
user and then pulls down another git repository <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/disposable-development-environments/#id9" id="id4">[4]</a> which contains a few more
shortcuts to simplify my work (at time of writing I have a bunch of changes on
my private git hosts which I haven't cloned to github so what's visible may not
even work but I assure you I have a git source which does should the laptop need
to be nuked) including setting up my shell, vim, etc. preferences inside the
cloud VM.</p>
<p>I can spin up new development environments for any project I want to work on
after that, isolating each project along with it's system and language-specific
package requirements, and the language specific tooling. Sometimes that is done
with Ansible playbooks, sometimes using project-specific bootstrapping scripts,
(all helpfully cloned into the Vagrant VM by the provisioning scripts) from the
Vagrant VM.</p>
<p>To recap: I navigate from the laptop where I do most of my work, to a VM on the
host, to a VM in the cloud where my workspace lives. It's a bit convoluted but
the battery drain isn't too bad (compared to just invoking ssh directly from the
laptop, which is an option but not always as convenient), all the bits are
highly agnostic to host OS, and the steps needed to get myself into a
productive mode on any given environment are really minimal and stable.</p>
<p>On a regular basis I seem to blow away the VM on the laptop and rebuild for one
reason or another and this has been remarkably stable over time, with only one
or two things I tweak every few months as I come up with more customizations or
resolve a new issue. Most recently I found that my VirtualBox upgraded to a
version more recent than that supported by Vagrant, so I just updated that and
everything started to hum again. On the other hand when I end up with any kind
of dependency hell on the jumpbox VM it's never further away than:</p>
<pre class="code text"><a name="rest_code_7a296c2ebb3a468d9dd81f2741cd6664-1"></a>$ vagrant destroy -f &amp;&amp; vagrant up
</pre>
<p>All things considered, I could simplify this set up considerably by eliminating
the jumpbox VM with the use of a virtual environment to contain the bits needed
to connect to the various OpenStack clouds I might operate my development VMs
on. The problem there is of course that this sort of refactoring usually
happens at highly irregular intervals and I just haven't found the time <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/disposable-development-environments/#id10" id="id5">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>We broke a downstream project in the last week before their release deadline.
This is about making it right for them.</p>
<p>Today members of the Glace contributors team were alerted <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/making-it-right/#id7" id="id1">[1]</a>
that we had broken and blocked OpenStackClient with our change <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/making-it-right/#id8" id="id2">[2]</a> to support
community images <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/making-it-right/#id9" id="id3">[3]</a>. Folks were already in the process of beginning to
diagnose the issue when my day started.</p>
<p>It became clear that we had lots of cooks in this particular kitchen so I
moved over to another VM where I was testing changes <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/making-it-right/#id10" id="id4">[4]</a> to the
python-glanceclient project related to the community images feature.</p>
<p>A candidate fix for the breakage became available <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/making-it-right/#id11" id="id5">[5]</a> from another contributor.
The change was small, one change to logic, and a new functional test. I
switched contexts to begin reviewing it and testing it. Zuul <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/making-it-right/#id12" id="id6">[6]</a> was reporting
a long queue, as lots of projects are feeling the crunch of the clients release
deadline, Ocata-3 milestone and feature and string freezes coming quickly.
Because of this I expected Jenkins gates to take their time coming back with a
vote so I started automated tests featuring just the additional test and without
the community images commit as a baseline. While that was running I started
combing over the changes in detail.</p>
<p>I got distracted from this by an email that came in signaling something in
Rackspace that needed me to respond quickly. That dispatched I returned to
see that the baseline testing showed the additional test should pass before
the community images feature, which is what was expected. I smashed the keys
a bit and started a test run to test the fix with the community images
feature. The work email from before resurfaced again, and so I hammered out
another response, caught up on IRC traffic, and returned to that code review.</p>
<p>When I completed the review, I tabbed over to look at the tests again and as
hoped everything passed. I updated folks on IRC and we proceeded to tag the
as ready to be merged. All the while, Zuul was busy grinding away on that
backlog of work before it could start the first pass of testing for this fix.</p>
<hr class="docutils">
<p>Fast forward</p>
<p>Jenkins reports that the fix failed to pass the multiple scenarios in testing.
Inspection reports a few broken functional tests, 23 in all. What did I do
wrong? At this point I see the same set of tests failing under different
scenarios, and those tests are all related to the v1 API. That's why I know I
screwed up the review and approved a bad patch. My suspicion is that I made a
mistake somewhere in set up of that second test run.</p>
<p>At this point, it's more important to get things fixed because downstream
projects are still broken. It's a Friday afternoon and I'm sure at this point
we have shot any productivity down there but nobody wants to come in to find
the world broken on a Monday morning on the week of a deadline, so I'm
expecting to kill non-critical distractions and get into it again. I know I'm
not alone in the desire to do that, but the original author of the fix has
finished up his workday and checked-out so we have one less core, and one less
set of eyeballs familiar with the context.</p>
<p>The failing tests are all functional tests, and all focused on the v1 API. The
failures seem to highlight a failure to create images (note: the candidate fix
that causes the failures was addressing an issue with updating images). That
leads me to suspect that the issue is with the specific change of the candidate
fix. I started combing through the file (related to the sqlalchemy db storage
engine, as opposed to the simple db storage engine which is the only other
concrete db engine supported. The change which broke things only touched the
sqlalchemy engine code, and the sqlalchemy engine code is specifically
exercised by some if not all of the failing tests, so that helps me choose
which engine to fix, but I inspected both as a means of contrasting them. I'm
staring at a function that runs if something is true, and some other thing that
happens otherwise... the pieces are coming together.</p>
<p>The important point here is that clues about the scope of the breakage are
invaluable in pinpointing potential causes. Identifying what is common among a
set of tests which break is a helpful step. In this case it was many tests
breaking because they all used a common bit of code to create an image in
Glance as part of setting the tests preconditions.</p>
<p>The whole thing started because there was a gap in the existing automated
testing, both functional and unit testing could have identified the problem
with the initial community images implementation but code coverage is always a
balancing act. The more tests you have, the safer you might be but time to
imagine them is limited when there are other features or bugs you could spend
that time on. And in any long-lived project the coverage you have tends to
never be good enough. I find it helpful to just keep my expectations low and
hope that the tests will catch stuff but never be surprised when a gap is
discovered. Expect that you are working with incomplete information.</p>
<p>The original candidate fix was crafted with the help of a functional test which
was used to first model the bug before the cause was identified. This is a
great way to begin pinning down the problem, not only because it allows you to
capture the information from a bug report but it gives you leverage toward
identifying the cause as you can quickly drive toward the point of the failure
by running the test, combined with debug breakpoints or trace logging as
breadcrumbs leaving a trail through the code. Finally having that test allows
you to verify your fix and address the gap in test coverage gives confidence
that you won't have to repeat this work later.</p>
<p>One final lesson is to be found in investigating why my testing of the first
candidate fix passed when they failed in Jenkins. For that I had to inspect my
shell history. The gist of it is that when I was juggling states with git I
ended up with an incomplete application of the candidate fix in my workspace.
Specifically I ended up without the change to the sqlalchemy engine at all. In
that case, good git habits and workspace hygiene is important. Managing
distractions is the other side of this because the point where I was
interrupted by email the first time is when I made my mistake in setting up
the workspace for the second run.</p>
<p>The fix is merged and the downstream projects are unblocked. Maybe Monday
will be less exciting.</p>
