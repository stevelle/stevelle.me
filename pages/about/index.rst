The author was most recently a software developer at Rackspace working as core
reviewer for a few OpenStack projects and is engaged with a few others. He
acted as technical lead for Glance with the `OpenStack Innovation Center 
<https://www.osic.org>`_. Steve was previously a principal developer and team
lead at Monsoon Commerce. He holds a BS in Computer and Information Science
from the University of Oregon.

He otherwise occupies himself with maintaining an old Portland home with his 
partner, keeping up on their gardening and yard improvements, and serving as a
warm bed to their aging cat. These activities mostly keep him too busy to
engage in the activities which used to consistute his hobbies. He has been
spotted stuffing his face with a taco and nodding approvingly in an episode of
a short-lived Food Network series.
